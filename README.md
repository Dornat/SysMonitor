# ft\_gkrellm

This is a quick project from CPP pool in school 42.

The goal of this project was to create sort of our own implementation of [GKrellM](http://gkrellm.srcbox.net/) in two days.

Teams are chosen randomly.

## Want to try it out?

Probably you can't, because we used some Mac OS specific stuff, but you can try.

$ git clone https://github.com/Dornat/SysMonitor.git
$ cd SysMonitor
$ make
$ ./ft_gkrellm
```
